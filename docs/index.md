## Introduction

Welcome to the Ki Wiki! This is the home for the Ki family of languages, which share common types and structures defined by Ki.Core (Implementations: [JVM](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Core-JVM), Swift, .NET):

1. [Ki Data (KD)](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD)): A declarative language that is concise and typed. KD is ideal for configuration files, serialization and similar uses. Example: `book "The Hobbit" published=1937/9/21`
2. Ki Script (KS): A simple portable scripting language, inspired by Swift, Kotlin and Python. It utilizes the same types and structures as KD and KM. KS also supports constraints in function parameters, units of measure, and many other unique features.

Note on KS progress. We've completed a version of KS that runs inside of [ClearWell](https://fellstreet.bio). We will be extracting that and releasing it with our usual MIT license.
